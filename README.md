There are four simple commands that will allow to access the vast knowledge the Liri.boT holds. To use the built-in commands you will need to declare node <command name> and then what you are wanting to search. 
Command 1 - movie-this. this function will search the OMBD which is an opensource movie database to provide the information requested. Using the command node liri.js (the function)--> movie-this and (what you want to search)--> the lion king.
